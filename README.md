A take on [neal.fun](neal.fun)`s [The password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/) and [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) where you do an infinite quiz and try and get as far as possible with out answering a question wrong.
This project was made in nextjs with groq and trpc, the questions are all generated by gemma 7b on groq for super fast question generation based of a handful of topics including science, math, history geography, technology and programing. The answer is check by mixtral-8x7b and returns is the user is correct or wrong and the reason way it thought that. The user can convince the ai model that the answer is correct, the ai might also accept ansers that are wrong saying that it is correct but then contradicting it self by saying that they are wrong in the reason field.
